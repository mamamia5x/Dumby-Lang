# Dumby-Lang
Wierd language that I made, it's supposed to be like Ook, or LOLCode. This is a dumb language.

## What is it?
It's a language that is basicly encrypted. Every key is a different key, like if you type the number "1", it'll decrypt to "a". You bascily write in HTML, but having to use different keys. 
## Online
You can use it online [here](https://dumby-lang.mamamia5x.repl.co/), but all files made will be saved pubicly. These files CAN be chagned by anyone. You can fork it on Repl [here](https://repl.it/@mamamia5x/Dumby-Lang), just press fork at the top. This'll make it more private.
## Download
Soon you should be able to download the project.
## Credits?
I used php desktop to allow you to run it with no internet, just an actual file. Check it out https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop.
